# Measuring-IA-Quality-Evaluation-&-Creation-of-Automatic-summaries.

This project explores AI quality measurement through the creation of automatic summaries using GPT‑4, using the Dataset *CNN/DailyMail*, a classic benchmark for summarization tasks.
The aproach of the LLM model is to generate summaries compared against human references, for evaluate this model automatic metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore) were applied to assess semantic and lexical quality.
Also a Linguistic Analysis was made, to do this a comparative POS tagging study was conducted to evaluate grammatical and stylistic consistency.
